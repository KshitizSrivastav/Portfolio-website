## Development Workflow

### Running the Website Locally

#### Method 1: Direct File Opening (Simplest)
1. Navigate to your project folder: `c:\Users\PC\Desktop\Website`
2. Double-click on `index.html` to open it in your default browser
3. The website will load locally using the `file://` protocol

#### Method 2: Using Live Server (Recommended for Development)
1. Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Open PowerShell in your project directory
3. Install live-server globally:
   ```powershell
   npm install -g live-server
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```powershell
   live-server
   ```
5. Your website will automatically open at `http://localhost:8080`
6. Changes will automatically reload the browser

#### Method 3: Using Python HTTP Server
If you have Python installed:
```powershell
# For Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# For Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000`

#### Method 4: Using Node.js HTTP Server
1. Install Node.js
2. Install http-server globally:
   ```powershell
   npm install -g http-server
   ```
3. Run the server:
   ```powershell
   http-server
   ```

#### Method 5: Using VS Code Live Server Extension
1. Install VS Code
2. Install the "Live Server" extension
3. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

### Local Development
1. Choose one of the methods above to run the website
2. Use browser dev tools for testing (F12)
3. Test on multiple devices and screen sizes
4. Make changes and refresh to see updates (auto-refresh with live-server)

### Code Organization
