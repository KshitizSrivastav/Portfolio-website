### **Option 2: Formspree (Alternative - FREE)**

    <div class="form-group">
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" required>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
        <input type="email" id="email" name="_replyto" placeholder="Your Email" required>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
        <input type="text" id="subject" name="subject" placeholder="Subject" required>
    </div>

#### Code Implementation:
Add this to your HTML head:

```

```javascript
// Replace with EmailJS integration
emailjs.init('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');

    from_name: name,
    from_email: email,
    subject: subject,

});

For more control, you can create a backend service.

#### Options:
- **Node.js + Express + Nodemailer**
- **PHP mail() function**
- **Python + Flask/Django**
- **Serverless functions (Vercel, Netlify)**

#### Example with Vercel Serverless Function:
Create `api/contact.js`:
```javascript
import nodemailer from 'nodemailer';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
    if (req.method === 'POST') {
        // Configure nodemailer with your email service
        const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
            service: 'gmail',
            auth: {
                user: 'your-email@gmail.com',
                pass: 'your-app-password'
            }
        });

        // Send email
        await transporter.sendMail({
            from: req.body.email,
            to: 'your-email@gmail.com',
            subject: req.body.subject,
            text: req.body.message
